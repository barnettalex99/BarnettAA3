Here's a summary of the requirements:

You must create the overall layout and the layout of all the content areas (header, footer, nav items, form) with either CSS grid or flexbox properties. (You may use box model and positioning properties to fine-tune the layout, but you should not use floats anywhere.) 
The layout should include all the areas described in the video: header, nav, content area containing the form, footer. 
There must be at least three navigation items. Each should change color smoothly when hovered over. The location of the navigation menu should change as shown between mobile and desktop views.
The layout should be fluid and responsive: that is, the elements should adjust smoothly upon resizing, and the nav should transition between mobile and desktop orientation, just as shown in the video.
The layout must be designed mobile first and include at least one functional media query.
There must be an HTML form that takes a name and email address, as shown in the video, and has a button to submit the data. The appropriate HTML form tags, elements, properties, and values should be used to create the form.
Form fields should highlight as in the video when selected/tabbed on/clicked on.
If the user does not submit an email address to the email field, an error message should appear that reads "please include @ in the email address", "enter an email address", or something similar. 
The HTML and CSS must be semantic overall: structural HTML elements should be used whenever appropriate, class and ID names should be semantic/meaningful.
The submit button in the form must have a gradient background that changes upon hover as shown in the video.
There must be a SVG icon, added and sized appropriately.
You must use at least one Google font or another custom font for your typeface.
Your code must be well organized into directories and subdirectories.
Stylesheets and assets must be linked and sourced properly and correctly so that they work the same way on the standard modern browsers (at the least, on Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on both Mac and Windows machines.
All code must validate per W3C standards.
As always, all code must be your own original work. If snippets are adapted from examples or online sources, they should be significantly customized and integrated into code you've written from scratch. (Simply tweaking minor details such as colors or measurements does not qualify as customization.) Submissions found to contain little more than code directly taken from outside sources will be reported to the Honor Court for suspected plagiarism.
Beyond the required elements, the styling (color, typeface, etc.) and content is up to you.
